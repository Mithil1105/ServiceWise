# Git and Supabase Deployment Workflow

## Git: No Push or Commit Unless Asked

- **Do not run** `git commit` or `git push` unless the user explicitly says to commit or push (e.g. "commit this", "push to remote", "commit and push").
- Making code changes does **not** imply permission to commit or push.
- If the user asks to "save" or "apply" changes, that means save files only—not git operations.

## Supabase: Deployment List After Every Change

After **every** prompt where you change code that affects Supabase, end your response with a clear **deployment checklist**:

1. **Edge Functions to redeploy**  
   List only the functions whose source files you modified (e.g. under `supabase/functions/<name>/`).  
   Example: *"Redeploy: `org-create-trial`, `org-join-by-code`"*  
   If none were changed: *"No Edge Functions to redeploy."*

2. **Migrations / SQL**  
   If you added or changed files under `supabase/migrations/`, say which need to be run (e.g. *"Run migration: `20260204140000_phase6_org_admin_user_management.sql`"*).  
   If none: *"No new migrations to run."*

Keep the list short and copy-paste friendly (e.g. `supabase functions deploy org-create-trial`).
